The obsolete monetary system of Great Britain consisted of pounds, schillings and pence. 1 pound was equal to 20 shillings, and 1 shilling - 12 pence. For recording, we used a system consisting of the sign of ? and three decimal values ??separated by dots. For example, the entry ? 5.2.8 denotes 5 pounds, 2 shillings and 8 pence (pence-plural from a penny). The modern monetary system, adopted in the 1950s, consists only of pounds and pence, with one pound equal to 100 pence. This pound is called decimal. Thus, in the new monetary system, this amount will be denoted as ? 5.13 (to be more precise, ? 5.1333333). Write a program that will convert the amount written in the old format (pounds, shillings, pence) into a new format (pounds, pence). The format of the program's interaction with the user can be the following: Enter the number of pounds: 7 Confirm the number of shillings: 17 Enter the number of pence: 9 Decimal pounds: ? 7.89 Most compilers use the decimal code 156. For some compilers, you can copy the pound sign directly From the Windows character table.
